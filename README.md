DATASETS IN THIS REPOSITORY

This repository contains various datasets commonly used in machine learning and deep learning for different types of tasks such as image classification, natural language processing, and sentiment analysis. Below is a brief description of each dataset included in this repository:

CIFAR-10
========
The CIFAR-10 dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset in machine learning. It consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. The 10 classes are mutually exclusive and include common objects such as airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deers, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.

- Applications: Image classification, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

MNIST
=====
The MNIST dataset is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Each image is a 28x28 grayscale image of a single digit between 0 and 9. This dataset is a subset of a larger set available from NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology).

- Applications: Handwritten digit recognition, Image classification.

FASHION MNIST
=============
Fashion MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images, intended as a more challenging drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Each image is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes of clothing items such as T-shirts, trousers, pullovers, dresses, coats, sandals, shirts, sneakers, bags, and ankle boots.

- Applications: Image classification, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

IMDB
====
The IMDB dataset is a binary sentiment classification dataset consisting of 50,000 movie reviews from the Internet Movie Database (IMDB). The dataset is divided into 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 reviews for testing. Each review is labeled as either positive or negative sentiment. This dataset is commonly used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks involving sentiment analysis.

- Applications: Sentiment analysis, Natural Language Processing (NLP).

REUTERS
=======
The Reuters dataset is a collection of news documents that appeared on the Reuters newswire in 1987. It is commonly used for text classification tasks. The dataset contains 11,228 news documents, categorized into 46 topics. Each document may belong to one or more topics. This dataset is widely used for testing algorithms for text categorization.

- Applications: Text classification, Natural Language Processing (NLP).
